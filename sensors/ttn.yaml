# Measured values range from about 0 to 1023 (in theory).
# In a first test I measured a range from 150 - 200 (water)
# to 1023 (dry).
#
# Scale is not linear, first temporary results:
# - very wet soil   200
# - wet soil        300 - 400
# - quite good soil 500 - 600 
# - too dry soil    > 700
#
# Current calucalation of percentage value is just a temporary assumption.
